# Feature Specification: Enhanced Front-End for Deck Upload and Learning Sessions

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to implement the front end properly, where I can upload a deck and then I will be able to have learning sessions. There is a basic version implemented but it is very barebones and there are some errors."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  COMPLETED: User wants enhanced front-end with deck upload and learning sessions
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’  COMPLETED: Identified deck upload, learning sessions, UI improvements, error fixes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’   Multiple areas need clarification (marked below)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  COMPLETED: Defined user flows for deck management and learning
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  COMPLETED: Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  COMPLETED: Deck, User, Learning Session entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’   IN PROGRESS: Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a language learner, I want to upload my own Anki deck files and practice vocabulary through interactive learning sessions, so that I can study my personalized content with engaging question formats and track my progress over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the dashboard, **When** I select a deck file (.apkg) and provide a deck name, **Then** the deck uploads successfully with progress feedback and becomes available for learning
2. **Given** I have uploaded decks available, **When** I select a deck and choose learning preferences (difficulty, question types), **Then** a learning session starts with properly formatted questions
3. **Given** I am in a learning session, **When** I answer questions and complete the session, **Then** I see my performance statistics and can return to the dashboard or start another session
4. **Given** I encounter an error during upload or learning, **When** the error occurs, **Then** I receive clear feedback about what went wrong and how to proceed
5. **Given** I have multiple decks, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I can see all my decks organized clearly with options to manage or study each one

### Edge Cases
- What happens when upload fails due to file format issues?
- How does system handle corrupted or invalid Anki deck files?
- What happens if a learning session is interrupted or the browser crashes?
- How does system behave with very large deck files? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file size limits not specified]
- What happens when no questions can be generated from a deck?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload Anki deck files (.apkg format) with a user-friendly interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate uploaded deck files and provide clear error messages for invalid files
- **FR-003**: System MUST display upload progress with visual feedback during file processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to organize and view their uploaded decks in a dashboard
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable users to configure learning session preferences (difficulty level, question types)
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate various question formats from deck content (multiple choice, fill-in-blank, translation, flashcards)
- **FR-007**: System MUST track and display learning session progress (current question, total questions, score)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide immediate feedback on answer correctness with explanations
- **FR-009**: System MUST display session completion statistics (accuracy, time taken, questions answered)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to restart or continue learning sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session persistence requirements not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support multiple user profiles for personalized learning [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-user requirements unclear from description]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide responsive design that works on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: device requirements not specified - mobile, tablet, desktop?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Deck**: Represents an uploaded Anki deck containing name, description, cards, and metadata
- **User**: Represents a learner with profile information, progress tracking, and personalized settings
- **Learning Session**: Represents an active or completed study session with questions, answers, timing, and performance metrics
- **Question**: Represents a generated question from deck content with type, difficulty, correct answer, and user response
- **Card**: Represents individual flashcard content from the original Anki deck with front/back text and metadata
