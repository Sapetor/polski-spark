# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Front-End for Deck Upload and Learning Sessions

**Branch**: `002-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/sapet/polski-spark/specs/002-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the existing React front-end application to provide a polished user experience for uploading Anki deck files and conducting interactive learning sessions. The current implementation is basic and has errors that need fixing. Focus on improving UI/UX, error handling, progress tracking, and session management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+, React 19.1.1, Node.js
**Primary Dependencies**: React, React Scripts 5.0.1, Express 5.1.0, SQLite3, Multer, Knex.js
**Storage**: SQLite database for decks/users/progress, file uploads via Multer
**Testing**: Jest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), responsive design
**Project Type**: web - frontend (React) + backend (Express) structure
**Performance Goals**: <3s deck upload for typical files, <500ms question transitions, smooth UI animations
**Constraints**: Browser file upload limits, SQLite performance for deck parsing, real-time upload progress
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user focused, ~50 UI components, support for large Anki decks (1000+ cards)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution template found but not populated. Proceeding with standard best practices:
- ✅ No complex architecture patterns needed - enhancing existing React/Express app
- ✅ Building on existing tech stack (React, Express, SQLite)
- ✅ Focus on UI improvements and error handling
- ✅ Test-driven development for new components
- ✅ Maintain existing project structure (client/server separation)

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - project has existing frontend/ and backend/ structure as client/ and server/

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- **Contract Testing**: Create test files for each API contract (3 contracts)
- **Component Extraction**: Break down monolithic App.js into focused components
- **Error Handling**: Implement React Error Boundaries and user-friendly error messages
- **UI Enhancement**: Add loading states, transitions, responsive design
- **Session Management**: Add pause/resume, persistence, recovery features

**Detailed Task Categories**:

1. **Foundation Tasks** (5-7 tasks):
   - Extract DeckUpload component with error handling
   - Extract LearningSession container component
   - Create question type components (MultipleChoice, FillBlank, Translation, Flashcard)
   - Add React Error Boundaries for major sections
   - Set up component testing infrastructure

2. **API Contract Testing** (6-8 tasks):
   - Test deck upload API (happy path + error cases)
   - Test learning session API (session creation + answer checking)
   - Test user/deck management API
   - Mock Server-Sent Events for progress testing
   - Integration tests for upload → session flow

3. **UI/UX Enhancement** (8-10 tasks):
   - Improve upload progress visualization
   - Add loading states for all async operations
   - Implement smooth question transitions (<500ms)
   - Create responsive design for mobile/tablet
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
   - Enhance session statistics display

4. **Error Handling & Recovery** (6-8 tasks):
   - Implement toast notification system
   - Add session timeout handling
   - Create session recovery from browser refresh
   - Add upload retry mechanisms
   - Improve server error message formatting
   - Add graceful degradation for network issues

5. **Performance & Polish** (4-6 tasks):
   - Implement React.memo for question components
   - Add lazy loading for heavy components
   - Optimize bundle size and loading
   - Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase A**: Foundation (component extraction + testing setup)
- **Phase B**: API contracts and core functionality tests
- **Phase C**: UI/UX enhancements (can run parallel with Phase B)
- **Phase D**: Error handling and recovery (depends on Phase A)
- **Phase E**: Performance optimization and polish (final phase)

**Parallel Execution Markers**:
- Component extractions can run in parallel [P]
- UI enhancement tasks are mostly independent [P]
- API contract tests can run concurrently [P]
- Error handling tests can run parallel with implementation [P]

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Dependencies**:
- Tasks 1-7: Foundation components (sequential dependency chain)
- Tasks 8-15: API testing (parallel after foundation)
- Tasks 16-25: UI enhancements (parallel after components exist)
- Tasks 26-32: Error handling (depends on components + APIs)
- Tasks 33-35: Performance optimization (final polish)

**Success Criteria for Task Completion**:
- All contract tests pass
- Component test coverage >90%
- Upload success rate >95% for valid files
- Question transition time <500ms
- Error recovery rate >80%
- Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
