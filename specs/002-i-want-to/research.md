# Research: Enhanced Front-End for Deck Upload and Learning Sessions

## Research Overview
This document consolidates research findings for enhancing the existing React-based language learning application with improved deck upload functionality and interactive learning sessions.

## Key Technology Decisions

### 1. React State Management for Learning Sessions
**Decision**: Use React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks with context for session management
**Rationale**:
- Current app already uses hooks-based state management successfully
- Learning sessions are relatively simple state (current question, progress, stats)
- No need for complex state management library (Redux/Zustand) for this scope
- Keeps bundle size minimal and code maintainable

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for current scope, adds complexity
- Zustand: Simpler than Redux but still unnecessary overhead
- Context + useReducer: More complex than needed for linear session flow

### 2. File Upload Progress Tracking
**Decision**: Continue using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time upload progress
**Rationale**:
- Already implemented in existing codebase
- Works well for long-running operations like deck processing
- Simple to implement and debug
- No additional dependencies needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSockets: Bidirectional but overkill for one-way progress updates
- Polling: Less efficient and responsive than SSE
- No progress tracking: Poor user experience for large files

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Implement cascading error boundaries with user-friendly error messages
**Rationale**:
- React Error Boundaries catch component-level errors
- Toast notifications for non-critical errors (network failures, validation)
- Modal dialogs for critical errors requiring user action
- Consistent error messaging across upload and learning flows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Global error handler only: Less granular control
- Alert-based errors: Poor UX, browser-dependent styling
- Console-only errors: Users can't recover from issues

### 4. Component Architecture
**Decision**: Extract reusable UI components from existing monolithic App.js
**Rationale**:
- Current App.js is 762 lines - too large for maintainability
- Create focused, testable components (DeckUpload, LearningSession, QuestionTypes)
- Enable component-level testing and reusability
- Follow React best practices for separation of concerns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep monolithic structure: Hard to test and maintain
- Over-engineer with complex component hierarchy: Premature abstraction

### 5. CSS and Styling Strategy
**Decision**: Enhance existing CSS with CSS modules or styled-components
**Rationale**:
- Current app has basic CSS that needs improvement
- CSS modules provide scoped styling without runtime overhead
- Styled-components offer dynamic styling based on props
- Both support responsive design requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tailwind CSS: Requires build config changes, learning curve
- Material-UI/Chakra: Heavy dependencies for current scope
- Plain CSS: Scaling issues with larger component count

### 6. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Expand existing Jest/React Testing Library setup with component and integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Already configured in project
- Focus on testing user interactions (upload, answer questions, navigation)
- Mock API calls for deterministic testing
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

**Alternatives considered**:
- E2E testing with Cypress: Valuable but outside current scope
- Enzyme: Deprecated in favor of React Testing Library
- No testing expansion: Risk of regressions during enhancement

### 7. Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Implement React.memo for question components and lazy loading for heavy components
**Rationale**:
- Question components re-render frequently during sessions
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Minimal code changes for significant performance gains
- Aligns with <500ms transition performance goal

**Alternatives considered**:
- Code splitting at route level: Current app is single-page
- Service worker caching: Complex setup for current scope
- Virtual scrolling: Not needed for typical deck sizes

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Component Extraction and Cleanup
1. Extract DeckUpload component with proper error handling
2. Create LearningSession container component
3. Separate question type components (MultipleChoice, FillBlank, etc.)
4. Add proper PropTypes/TypeScript for type safety

### Phase 2: Enhanced Error Handling
1. Implement React Error Boundaries for each major section
2. Add toast notification system for non-critical errors
3. Create error recovery mechanisms (retry upload, restart session)
4. Improve server-side error responses with actionable messages

### Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements
1. Enhance upload progress visualization
2. Add loading states for all async operations
3. Implement smooth transitions between questions
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Improve responsive design for mobile devices

### Phase 4: Session Management
1. Add session pause/resume functionality
2. Implement session statistics persistence
3. Add session timeout handling
4. Create session recovery from browser refresh

## Risk Mitigation

### Browser Compatibility
- Test file upload API across target browsers
- Fallback for browsers without SSE support
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features

### Performance with Large Decks
- Implement pagination for question loading
- Add deck size warnings during upload
- Monitor memory usage during sessions

### Data Loss Prevention
- Auto-save session progress
- Warn users before navigation during active sessions
- Implement session recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate >95% for valid .apkg files
- Question transition time <500ms
- Error recovery rate >80% (users continue after errors)
- Component test coverage >90%
- Zero critical accessibility violations

## Next Steps
This research provides the foundation for Phase 1 design and contract creation. All major technical decisions are resolved with clear rationale and implementation approaches defined.
