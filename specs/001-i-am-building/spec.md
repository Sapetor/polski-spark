# Feature Specification: Duolingo-like Language Learning App with Anki Deck Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am building a duolingo like app that takes an anki deck and creates questions of different types."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: language learning app, Anki deck import, multiple question types
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with: needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: import deck � generate questions � practice
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use multiple choice for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A language learner wants to import their existing Anki flashcard deck and practice with various question formats beyond basic flashcards. They upload their Anki deck file, and the system automatically generates different types of interactive questions (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, etc.) based on the deck content. The user can then practice these questions in a Duolingo-style interface with immediate feedback and progress tracking.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an Anki deck file, **When** they upload it to the system, **Then** the deck content is parsed and imported successfully
2. **Given** an imported Anki deck, **When** the user starts a practice session, **Then** multiple question types are automatically generated from the deck content
3. **Given** a practice session with generated questions, **When** the user answers a question, **Then** they receive immediate feedback and progress tracking
4. **Given** a completed practice session, **When** the user views their results, **Then** they can see their performance statistics and areas for improvement

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an Anki deck file is corrupted or in an unsupported format?
- How does the system handle Anki decks with multimedia content (images, audio)?
- What occurs when an Anki deck has insufficient content to generate certain question types?
- How does the system behave with very large Anki decks (thousands of cards)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload and import Anki deck files
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse Anki deck content and extract card information (front, back, tags, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate multiple question types from imported deck content including the ones that are already present in the system.
- **FR-004**: System MUST present questions in an interactive learning interface similar to Duolingo
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide immediate feedback on user answers (correct/incorrect with explanations)
- **FR-006**: System MUST track user progress and performance statistics
- **FR-007**: System MUST support simple profile creation like it already does
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle multimedia content support like images and audio if present
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate Anki deck file format before processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to edit, delete, organize decks

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Anki Deck**: Represents an imported flashcard collection with metadata (name, description, creation date, card count)
- **Flashcard**: Individual learning item with front/back content, difficulty level, tags, and multimedia attachments
- **Question**: Generated learning exercise based on flashcard content with type, correct answer, distractors, and feedback
- **User Session**: Practice session containing selected questions, user responses, timing, and performance metrics
- **User Progress**: Learning statistics including accuracy rates, completion times, mastery levels per deck/topic
