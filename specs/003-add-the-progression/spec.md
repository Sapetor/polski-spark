# Feature Specification: User Progression System

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-the-progression`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add the progression system for the user. Level XP and streak do not update but they appear in the system. This progression should make it so the user will see harder and harder cards with time."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature adds progression system with visible level/XP/streak
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: users; Actions: display progression, adjust difficulty; Data: level/XP/streak/card difficulty; Constraints: no updating initially
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Give XP points for success percentage at end of session based on their difficulty
   � Increase difficulty per level. Levels should be acquired as XP increases. Difficulty should be a mixture of number of different available questions and difficulty of these questions. 
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User can view progression, system adjusts card difficulty based on progression
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Display progression, track card difficulty, present harder cards over time
6. Identify Key Entities
   � User progression data, card difficulty levels
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding progression calculations"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Polish language learner, I want to see my learning progression (level, XP, streak) displayed in the application and have the system automatically present increasingly difficult cards as I advance, so that I can track my progress and be appropriately challenged to improve my skills.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they view their profile or dashboard, **Then** their current level, XP, and streak are visible
2. **Given** a user has completed multiple learning sessions, **When** they start a new session, **Then** the system presents cards with difficulty appropriate to their progression level
3. **Given** a user with higher progression, **When** they practice, **Then** they receive more challenging cards compared to beginner users
4. **Given** a user completes learning activities, **When** they return for future sessions, **Then** the card difficulty gradually increases based on their accumulated progression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has maximum progression level?
- How does the system handle users with no progression history?
- How does card difficulty scale for decks with limited advanced content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display user level in the user interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST display user XP (experience points) in the user interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST display user streak count in the user interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST track and store user progression data (level, XP, streak)
- **FR-005**: System MUST assign difficulty levels to cards in learning sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST present cards with increasing difficulty based on user progression over time
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure that users with higher progression receive more challenging cards than beginners
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain progression data even when level/XP/streak values are not actively updated
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how is progression level calculated - based on sessions completed, correct answers, time spent?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST use card difficulty considering vocabulary complexity, grammar concepts, sentence length, etc.
- **FR-011**: System MUST progress difficulty with linear increase withing a level and level will increased after a threshold has been reached. If performance is poor, difficulty should decrease.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Progression**: Represents a user's learning advancement with level, XP points, and streak count attributes
- **Card Difficulty**: Represents the challenge level of individual flashcards, used to match appropriate content to user progression
- **Difficulty Mapping**: Links user progression levels to appropriate card difficulty ranges for personalized learning experiences
