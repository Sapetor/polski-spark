# Implementation Plan: User Progression System

**Branch**: `003-add-the-progression` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-add-the-progression/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a user progression system that displays level, XP, and streak data in the UI and adjusts card difficulty based on user progression. The system awards XP based on session performance and increases difficulty linearly within levels, with level advancement at XP thresholds.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js), React 19.1.1, Express 5.1.0
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Express, SQLite3 5.1.7, Knex.js 3.1.0, Jest 29.7.0
**Storage**: SQLite3 database with Knex.js ORM
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library (frontend), Supertest (backend)
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux server + browser)
**Project Type**: web - frontend (React) + backend (Express) structure
**Performance Goals**: <200ms answer validation, <500ms question transitions, <3s progression updates
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 API response, progressive difficulty scaling, XP calculation consistency
**Scale/Scope**: Support for 1000+ card decks, 10+ progression levels, session-based XP tracking

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - Constitution template not configured, no specific constraints identified

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend (React) + Backend (Express) detected

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Database migration tasks for new tables (user_progression, progression_sessions, card_difficulty)
- Backend API implementation tasks for progression endpoints
- Frontend React components for progression display
- Integration tests for progression flows
- Difficulty calculation and card filtering logic

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Database Tasks**: Migration scripts, indexes, seed data
2. **Backend API Tasks**: Progression routes, XP calculation, difficulty adjustment
3. **Frontend Component Tasks**: Progression dashboard, level display, streak counter
4. **Integration Tasks**: End-to-end progression flows from quickstart scenarios
5. **Test Tasks**: API contract tests, component tests, calculation validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Database → Backend Models → API → Frontend Components → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution within categories
- Sequential between layers (DB must complete before API)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- 4 database migration tasks
- 8 backend API tasks
- 6 frontend component tasks
- 10 testing tasks
- 6 integration and validation tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
